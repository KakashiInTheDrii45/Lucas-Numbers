The first few numbers in the series of Lucas
numbers are:
{1; 3; 4; 7; 11; 18; ... ; LN}
The Lucas-numbers are determined by:
(𝐿1 = 1, 𝐿2 = 3, 𝐿𝑛+2 = 𝐿𝑛+1 + 𝐿𝑛
)
That is, a Lucas number is calculated as the sum
of its two immediate previous terms in the Lucas
series.
Using this information, write a C/C++ program that
defines a function Lucas() that calculates the n
th
number in a Lucas number sequence, where the
user enters n into the program interactively. For
example, if n=6, the program should display the
value 18.
The function accepts one integer parameter for the
value of n and returns the result to the calling
statement in main().
